[build]
  functions = "netlify/functions" # Directory where your serverless functions are located
  # publish = "public" # If you have other static assets in 'public' that are not served by Express

# This rewrite rule directs all requests starting with /api/
# to your serverless function named 'api' (api.js).
# It also handles the root path to serve your index.html via the function.
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat" # The :splat captures the rest of the path
  status = 200 # This makes it a rewrite (proxy) rather than a 301/302 redirect

# If you prefer to serve static assets from 'public' directly via Netlify and only API via function:
# [build]
#   functions = "netlify/functions"
#   publish = "public"
#
# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/api/*"
#   to = "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat"
#   status = 200
#
# # And if your index.html is in views and you want it at the root:
# [[redirects]]
#  from = "/"
#  to = "/.netlify/functions/api/" # Or adjust to make the function serve views/index.html
#  status = 200
```The first `redirects` block is generally simpler if your Express app handles serving its own `index.html` from the root `/` path. The `from = "/*"` will route all requests to your `api` function, and your Express router inside `api.js` will handle them.

**6. Update `package.json`:**

Ensure `serverless-http`, `express`, and `cors` are in your `dependencies`:
```json
{
  "name": "timestamp-microservice",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Timestamp Microservice for freeCodeCamp",
  "main": "netlify/functions/api.js", // Optional: Point main to your function entry
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js", // For local development (your original index.js)
    "dev": "netlify dev"    // For local Netlify function testing with Netlify CLI
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.17.1", // or newer
    "serverless-http": "^3.0.0" // or newer
    // "dotenv" is good for local development via index.js, not strictly needed by the Netlify function itself
